Stage I

Methane is a greenhouse gas with a warming effect 28 times greater than carbon dioxide. Globally, there are over 25,600 coffee shops, generating thousands of tons of coffee grounds daily. Whether disposed of in landfills or incinerated, these coffee grounds release substantial amounts of methane gas. The large-scale disposal of coffee grounds has escalated into a pressing environmental issue, yet many remain unaware of the threat it poses to our planet.

Shanghai alone boasts over 8,000 coffee shops, and Joni Cui, a Shanghai native and the founder of the mugu project, has taken action to address this issue. Through workshops that teach how to cultivate mushrooms using coffee grounds, the mugu project achieves several goals: raising awareness about climate change, equipping local residents with practical ways to combat it, and promoting local food production.

The mugu project leverages social media and curiosity to engage people in joining these workshops. On one hand, these workshops help individuals gain a deeper understanding of the urgency of climate change, which affects almost everyone in the present and near future. On the other hand, by converting environmentally harmful coffee grounds into nutritious materials and producing edible mushrooms, the project enhances the sustainability of carbon emissions while advancing local food production.
