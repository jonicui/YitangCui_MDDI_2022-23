Background
Mushrooms are a nutritious and tasty food source that can be easily grown at home using a variety of substrates.   Coffee ground waste is a readily available and inexpensive substrate that can be used to cultivate mushrooms.

In addition, the use of coffee ground waste for mushroom cultivation can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.   Coffee grounds produce methane when they decompose in landfills, and methane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. By using coffee ground waste for mushroom cultivation, we can divert this waste from landfills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
